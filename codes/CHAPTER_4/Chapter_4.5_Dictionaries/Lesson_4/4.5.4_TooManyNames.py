#Write a function called name_counts. name_counts will take
#as input a list of full names. Each name will be two words
#separated by a space, like "David Joyner".
#
#The function should return a dictionary. The keys to the
#dictionary will be the first names from the list, and the
#values should be the number of times that first name
#appeared.
#
#HINT: Use split() to split names into first and last.


#Add your function here!
