#Recall in the previous problem you counted the number of
#instances of a certain first name in a list of full names.
#You returned a dictionary with the name as the key, and the
#number of times it appeared as the value.
#
#Modify that code such that instead of having a count as the
#value, you instead have a list of the full names that had
#that first name. So, each key in the dictionary would still
#be a first name, but the values would be lists of names.
#Make sure to sort the list of names, too.
#
#Name this new function name_lists.


#Add your function here!
def name_lists(full_names):
    name_dict = {}

        first_name = name.split()[0]

        name_dict[first_name].append(name)
