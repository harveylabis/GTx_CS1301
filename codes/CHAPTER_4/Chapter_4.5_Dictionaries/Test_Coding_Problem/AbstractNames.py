#Write a function called abstract_names. abstract_names
#should have one parameter: a list of lists. Each list will
#be a list of strings, each with a first name and a last
#name, and each with the same first name.
#
#For example, this could be one list of lists your function
#might receive:
#
# [["David Joyner", "David Tennant", "David Beckham"],
#  ["Ananya Birla", "Ananya Agarwal", "Ananya Chatterjee", "Ananya Roy"],
#  ["Inés Sainz", "Inés Suarez", "Inés Melchor"]]
#
#abstract_names should return a dictionary. The keys to the
#dictionary should be the first names, and the values should
#be lists of the associated last names. The last names should
#be sorted alphabetically.
#
#For example, with the list above, the dictionary returned by
#abstract_names would be:
#
# {"David": ["Beckham", "Joyner", "Tennant"],
#  "Ananya": ["Agarwal", "Birla", "Chatterjee", "Roy"],
#  "Inés": ["Melchor", "Sainz", "Suarez"]}


#Write your function here!
def abstract_names(names_of_names):
    firstN_lastN = {}
    for names in names_of_names:
        first_name = names[0].split()[0]
        last_names = []
        for name in names:
            last_names.append(name.split()[1])
        firstN_lastN[first_name] = sorted(last_names)
    
    return firstN_lastN
        


#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print (although the order of the keys may vary):
#
#{"David": ["Beckham", "Joyner", "Tennant"], "Ananya": ["Agarwal", "Birla", "Chatterjee", "Roy"], "Inés": ["Melchor", "Sainz", "Suarez"]}
