#Remember asciitable.com from an earlier exercise? We're
#going to use it again. Remember, ordinal values for
#characters are given in the 'Dec' column of asciitable.com.
#
#Write a function called character_info. character_info will
#take as input a string with only one character. It should
#return a 3-tuple with three pieces of information:
#
# - In the first spot, the character itself.
# - In the second spot, the ordinal value of the character,
#   obtained using the ord() function (e.g. ord("a") -> 97).
# - In the third spot, what type of character it is: either
#   "letter", "number", or "punctuation".
#
#You may assume that anything that is not a letter (either
#upper or lower case) or a number is punctuation. You may
#also assume the ordinal will be between 32 (" ") and 126
#("~").

import string

#Write your function here!
def character_info(char):
    if char in string.ascii_letters:

#('7', 55, 'number')
#('`', 96, 'punctuation')
