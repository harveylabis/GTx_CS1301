#-----------------------------------------------------------
#To start, we know we need a functions called
#print_division_symbol and print_multiplication_symbol. Let's
#start with multiplication.
#
#To create a function called print_multiplication_symbol, we
#first enter this:

def print_multiplication_symbol():
    #As with all functions, it starts with the keyword 'def',
    #followed by the function name, then an open parenthesis.
    #If there were arguments, we would list them inside the
    #parentheses, but since there are not, we just close it.
    #Then, we end with a colon, just like with any other
    #control structure.
    #
    #Now we're inside the function, so we add the line of
    #code that does what we need the function to do:
    
    print("ร", end="")
    
    #Now we're done, so nothing after this should be indented.
    #If we indent whatever comes next, it will still be inside
    #this function.

#Next, we'll do the same for division:
def print_division_symbol():
    print("รท", end="")

#Now, notice that we declared those functions in the opposite
#order of the directions, but it doesn't matter. We can
#declare them in whatever order we want as long as we call
#them in the correct order:
print_division_symbol()
print_multiplication_symbol()

#Because we call print_division_symbol() first, the division
#symbol is printed first, even though the function for
#multiplication is declared first.
