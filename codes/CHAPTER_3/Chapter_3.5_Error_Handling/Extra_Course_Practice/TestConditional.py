#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Write a conditional that will print one of the following
#messages:
#
# - If the value of int1 is greater than the value of int2,
#   print "int1 is greater" (without the quotes).
# - If the value of int2 is greater than the value of int1,
#   print "int2 is greater" (without the quotes).
# - If the two values are equal, print "int1 and int2 are
#   equal" (without the quotes).
#
#With the initial values above, this should print "int1 is
#greater".


#Add your code here!
if int1 > int2:
    print("int1 is greater")
elif int2 > int1:
    print("int2 is greater")
else:
    print("int1 and int2 are equal")
