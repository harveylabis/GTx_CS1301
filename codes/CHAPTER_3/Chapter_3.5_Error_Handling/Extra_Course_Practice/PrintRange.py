#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.
#
#Write a loop (we suggest a for loop) that prints all the
#numbers from minimum to maximum. Each number should be
#printed on its own line, and you should print both minimum
#and maxmimum themselves. You may assume minimum will always
#be less than maximum.
#
#With the initial values for minimum and maximum above, this
#should print 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 -- each number would be on
#its own line, no commas.


#Add your code here!
