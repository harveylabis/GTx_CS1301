#The game Uno is a card game where each player's goal is
#to get rid of all their cards. A round ends when one player
#has gotten rid of all their cards. They then receive a
#number of points based on the cards left in their opponents'
#hands. The first player to reach 500 points across multiple
#rounds wins the game.
#
#Write a function called check_uno_winner. This function will
#take as input a tuple with at least 2 integers, but up to 8.
#Each integer will represent one player's score.
#
#If any player has more than 500 points, check_uno_winner
#should return the string, "Player X wins!", where X refers
#to the position of the player in the list who has more than
#500 points. Because Uno is played in the real world, the
#first player in the list should be referred to as Player 1,
#the second player as Player 2, and so on.
#
#If no player has more than 500 points, check_uno_winner
#should return the string, "Keep playing!"
#
#For example:
# check_uno_winner((0, 0)) -> "Keep playing!"
# check_uno_winner((505, 250)) -> "Player 1 wins!"
# check_uno_winner((250, 505)) -> "Player 2 wins!"
# check_uno_winner((25, 101, 362, 415)) -> "Keep playing!"
# check_uno_winner((25, 101, 426, 515)) -> "Player 4 wins!"
#
#Remember, the function should RETURN these strings, not
#print them. You may assume that only one player will have
#a score above 500.


#Write your function here!
def check_uno_winner(score_board):
    for i in range(len(score_board)):
        if score_board[i] > 500:
            return "Player {} wins!".format(i+1)        
    return "Keep playing!"

#Below are some lines of code that will test your function.
#You can change the value of the variable(s) to test your
#function with different inputs.
#
#If your function works correctly, this will originally
#print the same output as the examples above.
print(check_uno_winner((0, 0)))
print(check_uno_winner((505, 250)))
print(check_uno_winner((250, 505)))
print(check_uno_winner((25, 101, 362, 415)))
print(check_uno_winner((25, 101, 426, 515)))
