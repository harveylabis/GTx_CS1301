#Write a function called add_to_dictionary. add_to_dictionary
#should have three parameters: a dictionary, a potential new
#key, and a potential new value.
#
#add_to_dictionary should add the given key and value to the
#dictionary if the key is of a legal type to be used as a
#dictionary key.
#
#If the key is a legal type to be used as a dictionary key,
#return the resultant dictionary.
#
#If the key is _not_ a legal type to be used as a dictionary
#key, return the string "Error!"
#
#Remember, only immutable types can be used as dictionary
#keys. If you don't remember which types are immutable or
#how to check a value's type, don't fret: there's a way
#to do this without checking them directly!


#Write your function here!
