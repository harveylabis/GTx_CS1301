#Create a class called RightTriangle. RightTriangle should
#have two attributes (instance variables): opposite and
#adjacent. Make sure the variable names match those words.
#Both will be floats.
#
#RightTriangle should have a constructor with two required
#parameters, one for each of those attributes (opposite and
#adjacent, in that order).
#
#RightTriangle should also have a method called
#find_hypotenuse. find_hypotenuse should calculate the
#hypotenuse of the triangle based on the current values for
#opposite and adjacent.
#
#hypotenuse should NOT be an attribute of the class;
#instead, hypotenuse should be calculated and returned live
#when the method find_hypotenuse is called.
#
#The find_hypotenuse method should have NO parameters
#besides self. Instead, it should calculate the hypotenuse
#based on the current values for the opposite and adjacent
#attributes.
#
#Hint: In other words: opposite and adjacent will be
#attributes similar to guacamole and cheese in the Burrito
#class from Problem Set 5.1. find_hypotenuse will be a
#method similar to the get_cost method from the Burrito
#class.
#
#Hint 2: The formula for hypotenuse is the square root of
#opposite squared plus adjacent squared. The easiest way to
#find the square root is to use the exponent operator to
#raise the sum to the 0.5 power (e.g. sum**0.5).


#Write your class here!
class RightTriangle:
    def __init__(self, opposite, adjacent):
        self.opposite = opposite
        self.adjacent = adjacent
        
    def find_hypotenuse(self):
        return (self.opposite**2 + self.adjacent**2)**0.5


#The code below will test your function. If it works, it
#should print 3.0, 4.0, and 5.0 in that order.
test_triangle = RightTriangle(3.0, 4.0)
print(test_triangle.opposite)
print(test_triangle.adjacent)
print(test_triangle.find_hypotenuse())
