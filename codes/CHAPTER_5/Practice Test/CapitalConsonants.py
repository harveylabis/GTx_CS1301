#Write a function called count_capital_consonants. This
#function should take as input a string, and return as output
#a single integer. The number the function returns should be
#the count of characters from the string that were capital
#consonants. For this problem, consider Y a consonant.
#
#For example:
#
# count_capital_consonants("Georgia Tech") -> 2
# count_capital_consonants("GEORGIA TECH") -> 6
# count_capital_consonants("gEOrgIA tEch") -> 0

import string

#Write your function here!
def count_capital_consonants(word):
    counter = 0
    capital_vowels = 'AEIOU'
    for letter in word:
        if letter in string.ascii_uppercase and not letter in capital_vowels:
            counter += 1

    return counter



#The lines below will test your code. Feel free to modify
#them. If your code is working properly, these will print
#the same output as shown above in the examples.
print(count_capital_consonants("Georgia Tech"))
print(count_capital_consonants("GEORGIA TECH"))
print(count_capital_consonants("gEOrgIA tEch"))
